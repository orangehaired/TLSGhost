# TLSGhost 🔥

**Advanced TLS Fingerprinting & Browser Automation Toolkit**

> **Project Context**: This project was developed as part of a technical interview preparation for [ScrapeDo](https://scrapedo.com), a leading web scraping platform. It demonstrates advanced anti-detection techniques and TLS fingerprinting capabilities that are essential for modern web scraping operations.

TLSGhost is a powerful Go-based toolkit designed for TLS fingerprinting analysis, browser automation, and detection bypass techniques. It provides comprehensive tools for understanding and manipulating TLS client fingerprints, HTTP/2 signatures, and browser automation with stealth capabilities - perfect for web scraping scenarios where anti-bot detection is a challenge.

## 🌟 Features

- **TLS Fingerprinting Analysis** - Extract and analyze TLS client fingerprints
- **HTTP/2 Signature Detection** - Identify HTTP/2 client signatures across different browsers
- **Browser Automation** - Stealth browser automation with detection bypass
- **JA3/JA4 Support** - Full support for JA3 and JA4 fingerprinting methods
- **Akamai Bypass** - Tools for analyzing and bypassing Akamai's fingerprinting
- **Proxy Integration** - Custom proxy with TLS fingerprint spoofing
- **Multiple Test Cases** - Comprehensive test scenarios for different platforms
- **Web Scraping Ready** - Designed for real-world scraping challenges

## 🎯 Why This Matters for Web Scraping

Modern websites use sophisticated detection methods to identify and block automated requests:

- **TLS Fingerprinting**: Websites can identify bots by analyzing TLS handshake patterns
- **HTTP/2 Fingerprinting**: Browser-specific HTTP/2 settings can reveal automation
- **Browser Fingerprinting**: JavaScript-based detection of browser inconsistencies
- **Akamai Protection**: Many sites use Akamai's bot detection system

TLSGhost addresses these challenges by providing tools to:
- ✅ Analyze and replicate real browser TLS fingerprints
- ✅ Bypass Akamai and similar protection systems
- ✅ Maintain consistent browser signatures across requests
- ✅ Automate browsers while appearing human-like

## 📊 TLS Fingerprinting Examples

### JA3 Fingerprint Simulation: Verified!

Below is a verification of the JA3 fingerprint spoofing implemented in this project.

On the **left**, you can see the original JA3 fingerprint generated by a real browser (Chrome 137) on [tls.browserleaks.com](https://tls.browserleaks.com) or [peet.ws](https://tls.peet.ws).  
On the **right**, the exact same JA3 fingerprint is reproduced by the custom Go-based proxy client using [tls-client](github.com/bogdanfinn/tls-client)  and a manually constructed TLS spec.

This proves that the TLS handshake (ClientHello) generated by the Go client **perfectly mimics the browser**, down to cipher suites, extensions, and curve order – resulting in an identical JA3 hash.

### 🔬 Why is this important?

JA3 hashes are used by advanced anti-bot and fingerprinting systems (like Akamai, Cloudflare, and Imperva) to detect non-human traffic.  
By replicating a real browser's JA3 fingerprint, we can **bypass such detection mechanisms** and make scraping or automation tasks appear indistinguishable from genuine users.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24.1 or higher
- Chrome/Chromium browser (for automation features)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orangehaired/TLSGhost.git
cd TLSGhost
go mod download
```

### Basic Usage

#### 1. Akamai Fingerprint Analysis

```bash
make run-akamai
```

This will analyze your TLS fingerprint and compare it with known browser signatures.

#### 2. Browser Automation Test

```bash
make run-sannysoft
```

Runs stealth browser automation against bot detection tests.

#### 3. Proxy with Custom Fingerprint

```bash
# Start the proxy server
make run-proxy

# In another terminal, test with custom JA3
make run-proxy-client
```
